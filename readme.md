# Smart Parking lot System

## Overview
The **Smart parking lot system** is a backend application designed to manage parking spot allocation, user reservations, and parking zone preferences. It optimizes spot allocation by prioritizing proximity, floor preference, and designated parking zones.

This project is built using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and an in-memory database (arrays) for simplicity. It uses **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for authentication and **bcrypt** for password hashing.

## Features 
- **Parking spot allocation**:
  - Prioritize spots based on proximity, floor preference, and parking zones.
  - Real-time availability updates.
- **Reservation Management**:
  - Reserve and release parking spots.
  - Manage reservation time slots.
- **Session Management**:
  - Uses MongoDB session that enables transactions.
  - Transactions ensure that all database operations within them are atomicâ€”either all succeed, or none are applied.
- **Solid Principles**:
  - Applied solid principles to make sure my code is smooth and transparent.
